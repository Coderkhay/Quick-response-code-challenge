### What I learned

I have always had some difficulty when it comes vertically centering elements but with some trial and error i was able to center my QRcode using the style below;

```css
body{
    background-color: hsl(219, 59%, 88%);
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    transform: translateY(50%);
    height: 100vh;
}

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development
Website responsiveness has been quite a pain in the neck which would likely be my major focus from now on
